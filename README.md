Starter Questions / Things to Do

1. I want to center up the title "Amber's Widget" so it aligns with the rest of the content?

2. I would like the nav 'Things' to be spread edge to edge of the red, and touching it?

3. I would like there to be some space around the red box, so it's not touching/overlapping with any of the other boxes?

4. The images are breaking out of their containers.  I want them to fit inside the pink box?

5. The Part 1/2 heading text are against the pink box... I want them away from it about 5 to 10 pixels?

6. I need a footer.  I want it to look just like my nav header?

7. I want the overall width a little bigger.  Like, maybe 1000px?

8. I'd like the second 'holder1' div to hold 3 smaller containers instead of two... how do I do this?

9. I'd like the border aspect of each of the boxes to go away so I can have a cleaner looking site?

10. What else can I do to make this more streamlined and fancy looking?
